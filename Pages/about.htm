                        <p> My name is Sabrina Ho and I am a lifestyle, portrait and landscape photographer based out of the beautiful Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
                        <p>I don’t have much professional background as a photographer because I am so young. I did however win first in the Technology Student Association Western Regionals Photographic Technology Competition in 2013 and 2014 and won first in the Technology Student Association North Carolina State Conference Photographic Competition in 2014. I have done photography off and on for about 6 years now and have decide to dedicate myself to my work. I will try my best to capture your special moments in the perfect way if you choose me as your photographer. </p>
