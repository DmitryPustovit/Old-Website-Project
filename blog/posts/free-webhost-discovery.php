                    Recently I found out about something pretty neat. I needed to show someone a webpage that I was working on and I didn’t want to have to
                    call them on Skype and screen share or send screenshots. I wanted them to have the ability to explore it on their own. I needed a quick
                    and simple web hosting solution. I found one that is pretty simple and that a lot of people may not have known about.
                    <br /><br />
                    Google Drive. That’s right the free service from google can not only hold your documents but can host your website, with quite a few limitations.
                    <br /><br />
                    Let me just start off by saying that this DOES NOT replace a normal web host. When I was experimenting with this service I found that it was very 
                    limited. I uploaded the webpage and to my surprise the CSS link seemed to work, however the JavaScript/JQuery links did not. I don’t know if putting 
                    the scripts inside the html document would cause them to work, in theory it should which may solve that issue. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Another issue I imagine would arise but I myself have not tested is that you won’t be able to run any other language. For example PHP, Python, Ruby on Rails, etc. 
                    <br /><br />
                    There are also issues with domains. It gives you a long domain that is not easily memorized. You could forward to that domain but it’s not the preferred solution. 
                    <br /><br />
                    In theory you could set up a webpage on google drive and use it as a personal website with some effort. However, it would be simpler in the long run to just get a cheap 
                    webhost and use that. There are even some free webhosts available that aren’t too bad.
                    <br /><br />
                    It’s a rather simple process. You only have to do the following: 
                    <br /><br />
                    --Upload your website files to a Google Drive folder
                    <br />
                    --Set the folder’s sharing option to public
                    <br />
                    --Click the main html file in the folder (Home Page or index.html)
                    <br />
                    --It will bring up the document viewer and show you the actual html file in its text editor
                    <br />
                    --Click open, it will bring up another page that will allow you to edit the document
                    <br />
                    --At the top you should see a preview button 
                    <br />
                    --Press it and save the page that it opens
                    <br />
                    --The page that opens is the home page of you now hosted website.
                    <br /><br />
                </p>
