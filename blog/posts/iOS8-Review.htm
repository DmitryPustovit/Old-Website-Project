                <p>
					iOS 8 - Huge For Developers. Massive For Everyone Else.
					<br/><br/>
					This is my opinion of iOS 8 and if people should upgrade. I will be covering only the iPhones. 
					It will include a lot of the major drawbacks to the new update. I also mention some of the major 
					benefits of the new update and what make it pretty neat.
					<br/><br/>
					First of all. If you have an iPhone 4s, don't even bother. Even though apple says it is supported, 
					the new iOS slows your 4s to almost unusable speeds. This is expected, the 4s is outdated. This iOS 
					will most likely be the last update apple offers for the 4s although 4s owners are better off sticking 
					with iOS 7.
					<br/><br/>
					Now if you own an iPhone 5, 5s, or 5c there are a lot of new features in this iOS that may be worth updating, 
					if you willing to suffer a bit.
					<br/><br/>
					First of all, if you happen to have 6.8 gigabytes of free space then congrats, you can download the new iOS. 
					Everyone else, time to get rid of all those selfies. A lot of the negative reviews from people are based around 
					the massive storage requirement to download the update.
					<br/><br/>
					If you happen to be one of those brave souls that does manage to download and install the update then you do get 
					to enjoy a lot of really cool features along with a lot really neat things that make you hate your phone. First of 
					all, apple had included a lot of additional features to make your phone an even more important part of your life. 
					<br/><br/>
					Some of these features are: A better photo system (I didn't know the old one was bad...), an improved messaging system, 
					a better design (a lot of little features), a better keyboard (more android), family sharing (I know no one who this will 
					actually help), iCould Drive (hopefully this version won't be hackable), health (an health monitoring app, not the promise of health), better 
					connectivity with all your other apple devices (useless if an iPhone is the only apple product you have...), spotlight (better search). 
					The new update also comes with a ton of security fixes.
					<br/><br/>
					Now the new messaging system does look really neat. They added a lot of features that people wouldn't have thought 
					they needed but do make using an iPhone a better experience. Of course the major point of this update is not the features 
					that apple built in but the features that they are letting others build in. Developers are now allowed to access parts of 
					the phone that change visual aspects such as your keyboard, navigation center, etc.
					<br/><br/>
					On the negative side of things. Shorter battery life, slower performance, messaging problems, and issues with Bluetooth 
					connectivity have been reported. Sound like fun right? On the plus side, since the battery life is shorter you may not have 
					a chance to encounter these issues.
					<br/><br/>
					As you can clearly tell there are a lot of positives and negatives to this update. If you're happy with iOS7 then keep it. 
					Although a lot of apps may stop supports iOS7 as so many new features are given to developers in iOS8.
					<br/><br/>
					While this update is massive (figuratively and literary) it's really up to you. Take a good look at the new features at apples 
					website and decide but how badly you want access to those features.
