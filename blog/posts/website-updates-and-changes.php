				    One of my first memories of learning programming was reading a story about two programmers. One 
					was a programmer who work tirelessly day in and day out on software, writing every line of code 
					himself. The second programmer was as skilled as the first but he used short cuts. He didn’t rewrite 
					code he didn’t have to. He favoured simple methods versus complex methods. He did things quickly and 
					efficiently. Most importantly however, he did things from the beach instead of being cramped up in 
					his office or house.
					<br/><br/>
					Technically I’m at a pool that’s by the beach but the concept still applies. I was inspired to do some 
					work on my site. Some of the changes are going to go unnoticed because they only optimize and make things 
					a bit simpler for me. Some of the changes however will be extremely noticeable and will address some issues 
					that people have told me about. 
					<br/><br/>
					A big change is the new home page. It has contains a link to my blog as well as an about me section and a link 
					to the contact form.
					<br/><br/>
					One of these issues is that there is no method on my site for telling me about issues with the site. I will be 
					setting up a contact form. There will be a temporary form that will be based on a google drive form. I will eventually 
					develop my own and add that to the website. This form will also be used to contact me for a programming or design request. 
					<br/><br/>
					Overall there will be a lot changes. A few have already be implemented. A few are yet to be implemented but hopefully soon will.
