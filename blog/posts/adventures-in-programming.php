                    Lately I’ve been worked on a few projects. I have been working on a website for a friend of mine who is starting a business.
                    I have also been working on a submission for a Video Game Design Competition and a submission for an Open Source Software Development
                    competition. Ironically I have ended up using C# for both of them.
                    <br /><br />
                    The open source software submission is pretty basic, it is just taking up a lot of my time. The video game however is a different story. 
                    The base concept that I ended up going with is space. This involves the use of a lot of mechanics that I have never used before. Being that 
                    I am the only programmer on the team I find that a lot of the solutions that I come up with, while work (questionable), are not the best solution.
                    <br /><br />
                    For those that have worked with the Unity 3d game engine, I am having to work a lot with rigid bodies including force and torque.
                    <br /><br />
                    I’ll put up both the program that I am working on and the video game for download on my website for anyone who is interested.
