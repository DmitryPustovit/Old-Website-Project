                    It’s the 4th of July, at least in my time zone. Today is a day for celebration, for most that
                    means fireworks and a cookout. For me it’s about the same plus my laptop at my side. Today is
                    a day for celebration so I am taking a break from all of my current projects and just enjoying the day. 
                    <br /><br />

                    To celebrate today, the small bit of development I am doing is a little 4th of July theme add-on to my 
                    website. Many of my friends are out of the country today so I wanted to wish them all a happy 4th of July. 
                    That goes double for one of my friends who is in Taiwan. Hope everyone enjoys their 4th of July where ever 
                    you are.
