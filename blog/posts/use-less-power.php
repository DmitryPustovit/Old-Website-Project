                    I needed a break from the projects that I’m working on. I decided to add something neat, but simple to my website. A turn the
                    lights off button. When it is presses it makes a simple change in the background color.
                    <br /><br />
                    If you decide to use the website with the darker background I think that it will save some power. I also think that it will also put
                    less strain on your eyes.
                    <br /><br />
                    Besides that it’s also a pretty interesting feature to have on a website. I’m also thinking of adding a cookie so that it remembers the 
                    users preference of light or dark background. I’ll update this post if I decide to add this feature.
