                    When you host a website there will be days when your website is down. Companies promise 99%
                    uptime or 99.99% uptime, still there will be times when your website is down. This is a guide
                    on how to make the best of those time. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Some of you may have noticed but my site was down yesterday for a few hours. During this time, 
                    there was no redirect or error page, it simply returned the default webpage connection error. 
                    This is because I didn’t set anything up to work in case the website did go down. It never 
                    went down before and I didn’t expect it to. However, the unexpected does occur and the website goes down. 
                    <br /><br />
                    A simple method is to have a backup of your website running on some cheap or free webhost. If your website
                     goes down, have the error page simple redirect to that free webhost. These web hosts won’t be as nice or 
                    reliable but they will get the job done while your main site is down. However, if you are using a free webhost 
                    like I am, your options may be more limited. 
                    <br /><br />
                    You could always try to find another free/ cheap webhost to host a backup site. If however, you can’t seem to 
                    find one, you can always try a bit of humor. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Many webhosts offer the ability to create an error page of your own or you could host one on say Google Drive. 
                    This page can have the name of your site, a logo, and usually I like to see a funny phrase. This can be something 
                    like, “We are sorry, currently alligators are eating our servers… Just kidding but we are having server issues. We 
                    will try to get the site up soon."
                    <br /><br />
                    It adds a bit of humor and makes a bad situation look a bit better. A lot of companies seem to be doing something like 
                    this. Even Google. So your website can work like the professionals.
