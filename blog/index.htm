					iOS 8 - Huge For Developers. Massive For Everyone Else.
					<br/>
					This is my opinion of iOS 8 and if people should upgrade. I will be covering only the iPhones. 
					It will include a lot of the major drawbacks to the new update. I also mention some of the major 
					benefits of the new update and what make it pretty neat.

					In the month of August I decided I did not like the way my blog looked or the webhost it was 
					hosted on, I decided I would change both of those. Now I am a student, and as the school year 
					has started up again I have found it hard to really dedicate time into working on my blog. As 
					a result I give you this new blog. I looks much nicer and works a lot better however, all of my 
					old posts and temporary gone and some of the feature that I would like to include are missing. 
					These will be added hopefully in the coming weeks.

                    One of my first memories of learning programming was reading a story about two programmers. One 
					was a programmer who work tirelessly day in and day out on software, writing every line of code 
					himself. The second programmer was as skilled as the first but he used short cuts. He didn’t rewrite 
					code he didn’t have to. He favoured simple methods versus complex methods. He did things quickly and 
					efficiently. Most importantly however, he did things from the beach instead of being cramped up in 
					his office or house.

                    When you host a website there will be days when your website is down. Companies promise 99% 
                    uptime or 99.99% uptime, still there will be times when your website is down. This is a guide 
                    on how to make the best of those time.

                    It’s the 4th of July, at least in my time zone. Today is a day for celebration, for most that
                     means fireworks and a cookout. For me it’s about the same plus my laptop at my side. Today is
                     a day for celebration so I am taking a break from all of my current projects and just enjoying the day.

                    It seems like now days every major online retailer has their own security methods, it can be just as simple as a username and password or 
                    it can include an authorization code sent to your email. The methods vary based upon the different retailer. Usually I can suffer through 
                    the extra steps and lose 5-10 minutes and think, this will help make my account safer. However, never have I suffered through a process so 
                    irritating.

                    Recently I found out about something pretty neat. I needed to show someone a webpage that I was working on and I didn’t want to have to
                    call them on Skype and screen share or send screenshots. I wanted them to have the ability to explore it on their own. I needed a quick
                    and simple web hosting solution. I found one that is pretty simple and that a lot of people may not have known about.

                    While I was building this site I made several choices that I felt would improve the general user experience. One of these choices 
                    was to display only a set number of posts on my main page. It occurred to me when I made this choice that users may wish to view older 
                    posts. I decided that I would just put all my posts onto one page that I would call the archive. An issue arose, how would users find 
                    specific articles or articles on specific topics? My solution was an archive search that I think is pretty unique.
