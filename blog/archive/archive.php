                    One of my first memories of learning programming was reading a story about two programmers. One 
					was a programmer who work tirelessly day in and day out on software, writing every line of code 
					himself. The second programmer was as skilled as the first but he used short cuts. He didn’t rewrite 
					code he didn’t have to. He favoured simple methods versus complex methods. He did things quickly and 
					efficiently. Most importantly however, he did things from the beach instead of being cramped up in 
					his office or house.

                    When you host a website there will be days when your website is down. Companies promise 99%
                    uptime or 99.99% uptime, still there will be times when your website is down. This is a guide
                    on how to make the best of those time.

                    It’s the 4th of July, at least in my time zone. Today is a day for celebration, for most that
                    means fireworks and a cookout. For me it’s about the same plus my laptop at my side. Today is
                    a day for celebration so I am taking a break from all of my current projects and just enjoying the day.

                    It seems like now days every major online retailer has their own security methods, it can be just as simple as a username and password or
                    it can include an authorization code sent to your email. The methods vary based upon the different retailer. Usually I can suffer through
                    the extra steps and lose 5-10 minutes and think, this will help make my account safer. However, never have I suffered through a process so
                    irritating.

                    Recently I found out about something pretty neat. I needed to show someone a webpage that I was working on and I didn’t want to have to
                    call them on Skype and screen share or send screenshots. I wanted them to have the ability to explore it on their own. I needed a quick
                    and simple web hosting solution. I found one that is pretty simple and that a lot of people may not have known about.

                    While I was building this site I made several choices that I felt would improve the general user experience. One of these choices
                    was to display only a set number of posts on my main page. It occurred to me when I made this choice that users may wish to view older
                    posts. I decided that I would just put all my posts onto one page that I would call the archive. An issue arose, how would users find
                    specific articles or articles on specific topics? My solution was an archive search that I think is pretty unique.

                    I needed a break from the projects that I’m working on. I decided to add something neat, but simple to my website. A turn the 
                    lights off button. When it is presses it makes a simple change in the background color.

                    Lately I’ve been worked on a few projects. I have been working on a website for a friend of mine who is starting a business.
                    I have also been working on a submission for a Video Game Design Competition and a submission for an Open Source Software Development
                    competition. Ironically I have ended up using C# for both of them.

                    I’ve been working a lot with web development lately. A website for a friend of mine starting a business and this website. I’ve decided
                    that this page will not only serve as my blog but also as a place where I can test out various web development features that I haven’t
                    worked with before. Expect this page to change from time to time.
